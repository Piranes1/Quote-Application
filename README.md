# 💬 Quote Application

A modular Java console application designed to simulate quote generation for auto and property insurance. This project was created as part of my **Java training course at Allstate Northern Ireland**, where I currently work. Allstate offers internal training resources like this one to support hands-on learning and technical development.

## 📦 Project Structure

The application is organized into two main components:

### 🚗 Auto Quotes
- **Class:** `AutoQuote.java`
- **Purpose:** Simulates auto insurance quote generation.
- **Functionality:** Displays a sample auto quote with hardcoded details such as vehicle type, coverage level, and estimated cost.

### 🏠 Property Quotes
- **Class:** `PropertyQuote.java`
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates property insurance quote generation.
- **Functionality:** Outputs a sample property quote including location, property type, and coverage details.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (Standard Edition)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- GitHub for version control

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Piranes1/Quote-Application.git
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the Main.java file to execute the application.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Practiced object-oriented design with multiple classes.
- Reinforced Java fundamentals like method calls, class instantiation, and console output.
- Gained experience with GitHub workflows and public repo management.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Add user input to customize quotes dynamically.
- Implement random quote selection from a collection.
- Expand logic to include validation and error handling.

This training project marks a meaningful step in my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer. Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements.
