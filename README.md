# 📝 Quote Application

A simple Java-based console application designed to display a selection of motivational quotes at random.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as part of my Java training at **Allstate Northern Ireland**, where I currently work. Allstate provides excellent internal training resources and hands-on learning opportunities to support employee development. The Quote Application helped reinforce key programming concepts covered in the course.

## 🚀 Features

- Stores quotes in an array or collection
- Randomly selects and displays a quote each time the program runs
- Simple and clean console output for easy readability

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (Standard Edition)
- IntelliJ IDEA (development environment)
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

## 📚 Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding array/list data structures
- Utilizing Java’s `Random` class
- Strengthening foundational programming logic and syntax
- Practicing Git workflow with commits and push operations

## 📦 Setup Instructions

To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Piranes1/Quote-Application.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ)
3. Run the `Main.java` file or equivalent entry point

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add functionality to display quotes by category or author
- Integrate a GUI interface using JavaFX or Swing
- Read quotes from external files or APIs
